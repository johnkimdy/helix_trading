# Guided Policy Optimization (GPO) for Trading Strategy Adaptation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of GPO (Guided Policy Optimization) to automatically adapt the Helix-inspired trading strategy to changing market conditions. The approach combines reinforcement learning with guided policy updates to maintain performance during domain shifts and market regime changes.

## Core Concepts

1. **Market Regime Detection**
   - Continuously monitor market conditions
   - Categorize into regimes: bull, bear, volatile, flat
   - Track strategy performance by regime

2. **Policy Structure**
   - Maintain distinct policies for different market regimes
   - Use System 1 (fast) and System 2 (slow) architecture similar to Helix
   - Parameterize reward functions to adapt to changing conditions

3. **Guided Policy Optimization Process**

   ```
   Algorithm: GPO for Trading Systems
   
   1. Initialize regime-specific policies πθ_r for each regime r
   2. Initialize benchmark guide policy πβ (equal-weight)
   3. For each training iteration:
      a. Collect experiences using current policy
      b. Detect current market regime r
      c. Compute reward signal using regime-specific reward function
      d. Calculate KL divergence between policy πθ_r and guide policy πβ
      e. Update policy parameters:
         θ_r = θ_r + α∇(E[r(s,a)] - λKL(πθ_r||πβ))
      f. Periodically update guide policy if performance improves
   4. Deploy updated policy for specific market regime
   ```

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Reward Function Parameterization

The reward function should be parameterized to adapt to different market conditions:

```python
def calculate_reward(action, state, regime_params):
    """
    Calculate reward based on current market regime parameters
    
    Parameters:
        - action: Trading action taken (position sizes)
        - state: Market state features
        - regime_params: Dict containing regime-specific parameters
            - alpha_weight: Weight for alpha generation component
            - risk_weight: Weight for risk management component
            - cost_weight: Weight for transaction cost component
    """
    # Alpha component (return vs benchmark)
    alpha_component = calculate_alpha(action, state) 
    
    # Risk component (volatility, drawdown, etc.)
    risk_component = calculate_risk(action, state)
    
    # Transaction cost component 
    cost_component = calculate_costs(action, state)
    
    # Combine with regime-specific weights
    reward = (
        regime_params['alpha_weight'] * alpha_component - 
        regime_params['risk_weight'] * risk_component - 
        regime_params['cost_weight'] * cost_component
    )
    
    return reward
```

### 2. Adaptive Parameter Updates

Periodically update the reward function parameters based on recent performance:

```python
def update_regime_parameters(regime, recent_performance, market_conditions):
    """
    Update regime-specific parameters based on recent performance
    """
    # Extract relevant metrics
    sharpe = recent_performance['sharpe_ratio']
    volatility = recent_performance['volatility']
    correlation_with_market = recent_performance['market_correlation']
    
    # Adjust parameters based on recent performance
    if sharpe < target_sharpe:
        # Underperforming - adjust weights
        if volatility > target_volatility:
            regime_params[regime]['risk_weight'] *= 1.2
        else:
            regime_params[regime]['alpha_weight'] *= 1.2
    else:
        # Performing well - fine tune
        regime_params[regime]['cost_weight'] *= 1.05
    
    return regime_params
```

### 3. Market Regime Detection

Continuously monitor and classify market regimes:

```python
def detect_market_regime(market_data, lookback_period=20):
    """
    Detect current market regime based on recent data
    """
    returns = market_data['returns'][-lookback_period:]
    volatility = np.std(returns) * np.sqrt(252)
    trend = np.mean(returns) * 252
    
    if trend > 0.10 and volatility < 0.15:
        return 'bull'
    elif trend < -0.10 and volatility < 0.20:
        return 'bear'
    elif volatility > 0.20:
        return 'volatile'
    else:
        return 'flat'
```

### 4. Guide Policy Selection

Select appropriate guide policies based on historical performance:

```python
def select_guide_policy(current_regime, performance_history):
    """
    Select guide policy based on historical performance
    """
    # Find periods of similar market regimes
    similar_periods = [p for p in performance_history 
                      if p['regime'] == current_regime]
    
    # Select best performing policy from similar periods
    if similar_periods:
        best_period = max(similar_periods, key=lambda x: x['sharpe_ratio'])
        return best_period['policy']
    else:
        # Default to conservative policy if no similar regimes found
        return default_guide_policy
```

## Integration with Helix Trading System

To integrate GPO with the existing Helix-inspired trading system:

1. **System 2 Enhancement**: Modify the strategic model to include regime detection and policy selection
2. **System 1 Adaptation**: Update the tactical model's parameters based on selected policy
3. **Reward Tracking**: Record performance metrics by regime for policy improvement

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Key hyperparameters to tune:

- KL divergence penalty weight (λ)
- Learning rates by regime
- Reward function weights
- Regime detection thresholds

## Deployment Strategy

1. Run backtests across different market regimes
2. Start with conservative policies and gradually adapt
3. Monitor regime shifts and policy performance
4. Establish guardrails for maximum drawdown and leverage

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Regular evaluation cycle:

1. Measure performance by regime vs benchmarks
2. Track policy drift between updates
3. Evaluate stability of regime detection
4. Monitor for overfitting to specific regimes
